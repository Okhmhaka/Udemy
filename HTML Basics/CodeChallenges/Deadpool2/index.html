        <p>
            Deadpool is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name.
            Distributed by 20th Century Fox, it is a spin-off in the X-Men film series and the eighth installment
            overall. Directed by Tim Miller (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Rhett Reese and Paul
            Wernick, it stars Ryan Reynolds in the title role alongside Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T. J. Miller, Gina
            Carano, and Brianna Hildebrand. In the film, Wade Wilson hunts the man who gave him mutant abilities and a
            scarred physical appearance, becoming the anti-hero Deadpool.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Wilson survives due to his new healing abilities and seeks out Vanessa. He does not reveal to her that he is
            alive out of fear that she will reject his new appearance. After consulting with his best friend Weasel,
            Wilson decides to hunt down Ajax for the cure. He becomes a masked vigilante, adopting the name "Deadpool"
            (from Weasel picking him in a dead pool), and moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al. Over
            the course of the next year, he questions and murders many of Ajax's associates until one, the recruiter,
            reveals Ajax's whereabouts. This information allows Deadpool to enact the ambush. He kills all of Ajax's
            henchmen, subdues Ajax himself, and demands the cure, but the X-Man Colossus and his trainee Negasonic
            Teenage Warhead interrupt him. Colossus attempts to convince Deadpool to mend his ways and join the X-Men,
            but Deadpool turns him down. Taking advantage of this distraction, Ajax escapes and regroups with Angel
            Dust. The two of them then head to Weasel's bar, where Ajax hears of Vanessa.

        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>
            Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool, a wisecracking mutant mercenary with accelerated healing, but
            severe scarring over his body after undergoing an experimental cancer treatment.[4][5] The writers described
            Deadpool as "fun to hang out with... in short doses".[6] Reynolds promised a more "authentic" and
            comic-faithful version of the character than the one he portrayed in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009).[7] The
            character becomes aware he is in a film after becoming Deadpool, though before this, Wilson does make a joke
            about Reynolds' role in Green Lantern (2011)
